C++ is an object oriented programming language.
Some elements of OOP are:
1) Modelling - A model is a representation of reality.
2) Encapsulation - keeping data and operations within their models.
    Models must only include information about themselves.
    Operations must be concise

The C++ construct for models are classes.
Classes contain members of two types: Data and Functions.
An instance of a class is known as an object.

Access Specifiers: The class members may be public or private.
Public members are accessible by any part of the code.
Private members are accessible only within the class.
Protected class members are accessible in inherited classes 

Inheritance and Polymorphism:
A class may have subclasses based on it.
A subclass may inherit members from its superclass.
Polymorphism - The base class may  define some function,
but the implementation of that function may be different among the different
inherited subclasses. This makes these sibling classes polymorphic.
