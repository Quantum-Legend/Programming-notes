A Poem in Python!
These are the various ways to display text and messages over multiple lines in python.

print('1') #Just a counter for the paragraphs
#printing or displaying text over multiple lines!
print("There once was a movie star icon")

print("They learned how to code")

print("and lit up the night using Python")

print('2')
#" (double quotes) or ' (single quotes) both can be used to enclose strings in Python!

print('They learned how to code')
print('a device that sure glowed')

print('3')
#There's also this way to do it... If you're a lazy programmer XD
#\n is an escape function, it breaks the line and puts the succeeding string on a new line.

#The output of the first 4 is the same, even if each of them was written in a different way!
#Thus, there can be multiple ways to do something, and multiple solutions to any given problem!

'''Triple quotes can be used to write multi-line comments
In this way
Or you can just use # on each line'''

"""Both
Triple Single quotes (')
Or 
Triple Double quotes (")
Can be used to write mult-line comments"""
