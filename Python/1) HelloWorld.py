First Program
Every first program in a programming language is to display the phrase 'Hello World'
"""

#Here's how you print "Hello World" in Python:
print('Hello World')

'''The print() is a function that displays the stuff which is enclosed in its parantheses.
The text to be displayed is written in quotes and it is called a string.
A String is an ordered sequence of characters.
Both single quotes (') or double quotes  (") can be used to display text (aka "a String")'''

print("Hi World")

#Using a # lets you write comments in your code
#Just like this
'''Triple quotes also allow you to do the same thing'''
# is for single line while triple quotes (""" or ''') are for multi-line comments
"""The interpreter skips over the comments while execution of the code
So comments can be used to make notes or 'comments' in your code"""
